# Screenpipe CLI

Use `bun x screenpipe@latest` to run CLI commands. No separate install needed.

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `bun x` commands from a clean temp directory to avoid node_modules conflicts:
```bash
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest <command>
```

**Rules:** every invocation is `cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest …` · never drop the `cd` prefix · never drop `@latest` · copy the examples below verbatim rather than shortening them · because the `cd` changes your working directory, **any path you pass must be absolute** (`~/...` or `/...`), never relative (`./my-pipe`).

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows: the CLI always runs under bash, and `mktemp` is present on all three (on Windows via the bundled git-portable `usr/bin`).

> **Sandboxed shells:** some agents (e.g. Codex) block all shell network access, so `bun x` cannot fetch the package and CLI calls to `localhost:3030` fail instantly. If that happens, use the screenpipe MCP tools instead of the CLI.

## Shell

- **All platforms** → `bash` (on Windows, the bundled git-portable bash is used automatically)

> **Note:** the bash tool truncates output around ~50 KB. Long listings (`connection list`, `pipe list`, etc.) are sorted with connected/enabled rows first, but if you need a specific row, pipe through `grep` or `head` rather than scanning the full output — e.g. `cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection list | grep -E 'browser|connected'`.

## Pipe Management

Pipes are markdown-based AI automations that run on schedule. Each pipe lives at `~/.screenpipe/pipes/<name>/pipe.md`.

### Commands

```bash
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe list                    # List all pipes (compact table)
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe enable <name>           # Enable a pipe
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe disable <name>          # Disable a pipe
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe run <name>              # Run once immediately (for testing)
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe logs <name>             # View execution logs
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe install <url-or-abs-path>  # Install from GitHub or an absolute local path
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe delete <name>           # Delete a pipe
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe models list             # View AI model presets
```

### Creating a Pipe

Create `~/.screenpipe/pipes/<name>/pipe.md` with YAML frontmatter + prompt:

```markdown
---
schedule: every 30m
enabled: true
preset: ["Primary", "Fallback"]
---

Your prompt instructions here. The AI agent executes this on schedule.

## What to do

1. Query screenpipe search API for recent activity
2. Process results
3. Output summary / send notification
```

**Schedule syntax**:
- Recurring: `every 30m`, `every 1h`, `every day at 9am`, `every monday at 9am`, or cron `*/30 * * * *`, `0 9 * * *`
- One-off (fires once, then auto-disables): `at <RFC3339 timestamp>` — e.g. `at 2026-04-29T17:00:00-07:00`
- Manual only: `manual` (run via `pipe run` or API trigger)

**One-off scheduled tasks** (use this when the user says "in 2 days", "tomorrow at 5pm", "next Monday", "remind me to check X later", or any other future-time deferred action):

```yaml
---
schedule: at 2026-04-29T17:00:00-07:00
enabled: true
preset: auto
---

Check Gmail for a reply from Mark about the HIPAA evidence pack.
If found, summarize and send a notification. If not, note it.
```

Resolve "in 2 days" / "tomorrow 5pm" / "next Monday" against the user's local timezone (which is in the context header), format as RFC3339 with offset, and put it in the `at <iso>` schedule.

When fired, the pipe auto-disables itself — `enabled: false` is set in the local-overrides file. The pipe.md stays on disk as history. Users see upcoming one-offs in the chat sidebar's "upcoming" section with a countdown ("in 2d 4h"). To cancel before fire time: `pipe disable <name>`. To re-run after firing: `pipe enable <name>` then `pipe run <name>` (or set a new `at <iso>`).

**Config fields**: `schedule`, `enabled` (bool), `preset` (string or array — e.g. `"Oai"` or `["Primary", "Fallback"]`), `history` (bool — include previous output as context)

Screenpipe prepends a context header with time range, timezone, OS, and API URL before each execution. No template variables needed.

After creating:
```bash
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe install ~/.screenpipe/pipes/my-pipe
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe enable my-pipe
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest pipe run my-pipe   # terminal-only; in-app chat uses the workflow below
```

### Testing from in-app chat

The cloud JWT is intentionally absent from Bash. Do not expose or recover it, and do not use standalone `pipe run`. Test through the authenticated desktop runtime:

```bash
api="${SCREENPIPE_LOCAL_API_URL:-http://localhost:3030}"
auth="Authorization: Bearer $SCREENPIPE_LOCAL_API_KEY"
curl -sS -X POST -H "$auth" "$api/pipes/my-pipe/run"
curl -sS -H "$auth" "$api/pipes/my-pipe/logs"
```

`{"success":true}` means the run started, not that it passed. Poll for a new terminal log. Bind only after `success: true`; otherwise report its `stderr` and leave the Live View unchanged.

### Editing Config

Edit frontmatter in `~/.screenpipe/pipes/<name>/pipe.md` directly, or use the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/pipes/<name>/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"config": {"schedule": "every 1h", "enabled": true}}'
```

### Output & Artifacts

Pipes can produce user-facing output files that appear in the Artifacts library.

**Standard path** — for files inside the pipe directory:
- Declare them in frontmatter under `artifacts:`:
  ```yaml
  artifacts:
    - path: "output/report.md"
      title: "Weekly Report"
      kind: "markdown"
  ```
- Write results to the declared path. After execution, they are auto-registered.

**External path** — for files outside the pipe directory (shared locations, user folders, vaults):
- Use the `register_artifact` tool during execution:
  ```
  register_artifact(file_path="/path/to/deliverable.md", title="Weekly Report")
  ```
- The tool registers an existing file by its absolute path. The file must already exist on disk.
- Only register finished deliverables — not scratch files, caches, or internal state.

### Rules

1. Use `pipe list` (not `--json`) — table output is compact
2. Never dump full pipe JSON — can be 15MB+
3. Check logs first when debugging: `pipe logs <name>`
4. Outside in-app chat, use `pipe run <name>` before waiting for a schedule; in-app chat uses the authenticated runtime above

## Connection Management

Manage integrations (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Email, Todoist, Teams) from the CLI.

### Commands

```bash
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection list              # List all connections + status
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection list --json       # JSON output
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection get <id>          # Show status + non-secret settings
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection get <id> --json   # JSON output
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection set <id> key=val  # Save credentials
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection test <id>         # Test a connection
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection remove <id>       # Remove credentials
```

### Examples

```bash
# Set up Telegram
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection set telegram bot_token=123456:ABC-DEF chat_id=5776185278

# Set up Slack webhook
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection set slack webhook_url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...

# Verify it works
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection test telegram

# Check what's connected
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && bun x screenpipe@latest connection list
```

Connection IDs: `telegram`, `slack`, `discord`, `email`, `todoist`, `teams`, `google-calendar`, `openclaw`

Credentials are stored locally and are not printed by `connection get`.

**Per-integration details**: don't guess API shapes from this skill. Run `connection list` for self-describing local endpoints. `connection get <id>` returns only status and non-secret settings.

## Publishing pipes to the store

```bash
screenpipe pipe publish <pipe-name>
```

Reads `~/.screenpipe/pipes/<pipe-name>/pipe.md`, extracts title/description/icon/category from YAML frontmatter, and publishes to the screenpipe pipe store. Requires auth (SCREENPIPE_API_KEY env var or `~/.screenpipe/auth.json`).
